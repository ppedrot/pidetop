PIDEtop
=======

This repository provides a toplevel plugin to make Coq speak the PIDE protocol.


Building
--------

Building is driven by coq_makefile and make

$ export COQBIN=/your/path/to/coq/trunk/bin/

$ /your/path/to/coq/trunk/bin/coq_makefile -f Make > Makefile

$ make install-toploop

See compatibility, below, for notes.


Compatibility
-------------

As of revision b1a4d6befffad9c1d8cf23ee4d16b78e47de0000, the plugin is known to work with the following versions of Coq and PIDE:

### Coq
- Branch: trunk at https://github.com/coq/coq
- Revision: `cfb5201e2ebc2516e3de7c578355db8bd4f08d35`
- Notes:
    * This revision on Coq trunk introduces an API change: query routing information is kept around in Coq. 
    * For previous versions of Coq trunk, use a slightly older version of PIDEtop.
    

### PIDE
- Branch: default at https://bitbucket.org/Carst/pide_notes/
- Revision: 16be1c3e83f795a879765eaffde7cb64a3a19f3e
- Notes:
    * This revision redefines the define_command protocol message for Coq sessions: PIDE notifies Coq which commands should be ignored.
    * Later revisions do not break the behaviour. In particular, the tag 'Coq-0.1.0' on the 'standalone' branch also works with this plugin.
    * The PIDE_notes repository is a Mercurial repository, not a Git one.
    * The README.coq file in the repo provides a brief overview on how to run Isabelle/jEdit with Coq. These notes are a bit outdated/broken. The main problem is that ./bin/isabelle build no longer compiles the jars, and therefore does not build Pure, or creates the jEdit folder. A partial solution is to get a clean version of Isabelle from http://isabelle.in.tum.de and use the ./bin/isabelle build script from that distribtion to obtain a Pure heap. That clean version can also be used instead of the Tools/jEdit/dist/jars relative to the repository.
