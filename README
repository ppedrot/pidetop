PIDEtop
=======

This repository provides sources for a toplevel plugin to make Coq speak the
PIDE protocol. If you are looking for a release to go with PIDE, checkout the
PIDEtop branch (the default branch of this repository). 

The source code of version 0.2.0 can also be downloaded as an archive from the [downloads page](https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop/downloads) (Under the 'tags' tab).

**pidetop-0.2.0.zip contains a pre-compiled binary for Windows, not the source code.**

Installing
----------

You can build this version of the toploop using Opam (using the Coq 8.5 repository), the instructions are in the [Opam repository](https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/opam)

$ export COQBIN=/your/path/to/coq/bin/

$ $COQBIN/coq_makefile -f Make > Makefile

$ make install-toploop
