PIDEtop
=======

This repository provides a toplevel plugin to make Coq speak the PIDE protocol. If you are looking for a release to go with PIDE, checkout the PIDEtop branch (the default branch of this repository).

Building
--------

Building is driven by coq_makefile and make

$ export COQBIN=/your/path/to/coq/trunk/bin/

$ /your/path/to/coq/trunk/bin/coq_makefile -f Make > Makefile

$ make install-toploop

See compatibility, below, for notes.


Compatibility
-------------

As of revision b1a4d6befffad9c1d8cf23ee4d16b78e47de0000, the plugin is known to work with the following versions of Coq and PIDE:

### Coq
- Branch: trunk at https://github.com/coq/coq
- Revision: [c6d356844ec857b376302c50c925faae558814a9](https://github.com/coq/coq/commit/c6d356844ec857b376302c50c925faae558814a9)
- Notes:
    * This revision of Coq fixes issue #18 reported on the Pide_notes repository: too many coqtop processes were used, with large amount of memory. Because this fix induced an API change, it also requires an updated PIDEtop.
    * For previous versions of Coq trunk, use a slightly older version of PIDEtop.
    

### PIDE
- Branch: standalone at https://bitbucket.org/Carst/pide_notes/ (the eventual new version of Coq/jEdit)
- Revision 829097ffdd02
- Notes:
    * This revision adds support for the new behaviour of query-prints. Using an older version (e.g., the 0.1.1 release) should not cause any real problems, but the status indicator of the query panel will remain spinning.
    * The PIDE_notes repository is a Mercurial repository, not a Git one.
    * The README.coq file in the repo provides a brief overview on how to run Isabelle/jEdit with Coq. These notes are a bit outdated/broken. The main problem is that ./bin/isabelle build no longer compiles the jars, and therefore does not build Pure, or creates the jEdit folder. A partial solution is to get a clean version of Isabelle from http://isabelle.in.tum.de and use the ./bin/isabelle build script from that distribtion to obtain a Pure heap. That clean version can also be used instead of the Tools/jEdit/dist/jars relative to the repository.
