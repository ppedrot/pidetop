PIDEtop
=======

This repository provides sources for a toplevel plugin to make Coq speak the
PIDE protocol. If you are looking for a release to go with PIDE, checkout the
PIDEtop branch (the default branch of this repository). 

The source code of version 0.2.0 can also be downloaded as an archive from the [downloads page](https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop/downloads) (Under the 'tags' tab).


Installing
----------

If you have installed Coq using Opam, you can use Opam to install pidetop:

```
#!shell

opam repo add pide http://bitbucket.org/coqpide/opam.git
opam install pidetop
```

Alternatively, building by hand from these sources is driven by coq_makefile and make

$ export COQBIN=/your/path/to/coq/bin/

$ $COQBIN/coq_makefile -f Make > Makefile

$ make install-toploop


For Windows, we provide a [pre-compiled binary](https://bitbucket.org/coqpide/pidetop/downloads/pidetop-windows-0.2.0.zip), unpack the zip file in the toploop directory of the Coq installation directory (usually, C:\Coq\lib\toploop)
