Changes from 0.1.1. 


Features added:

Bugs fixed:
  - Issue #2: New worker architecture and feedback hooks take care of duplicate messages (more a Coq issue than a PIDE issue)
  - Issue #3: Using the new feedback hooks, PIDE can signal 'aborted' commands more properly.
  - Issue #9: Proper implementation of entity lookup.
  - Issue #10: admit does not warn that an axiom was added.
